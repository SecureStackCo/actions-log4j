## Create your SecureStack API Key as GitHub Secret

1. Create a [SecureStack](https://app.securestack.com) account using your GitHub credentials.  You get 20 scans for free and you don't need to add a credit card.
2. Once you are logged in go to "Profile" in the black drawer on the left, and then -> GENERATE KEY tab.
3. Generate an API key and copy the value.
4. Go to Settings for your GitHub repository and click on Secrets -> Actions at the bottom left.
5. Create a new secret named SECURESTACK_API_KEY and paste the value from step 2 into the field.

## Retreiving your SecureStack Application ID

1. Log in to [SecureStack](https://app.securestack.com).
2. Open the application you wish to analyse.  If you haven't created a managed application you can follow the directions in this [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/mapgawLMVKg) to create one.  
3. Copy the value of the application id on the View Application screen.
4. Go to Settings for your GitHub repository and click on Secrets -> Actions at the bottom left.
5. Create a new secret named SECURESTACK_APP_ID and paste the value from step 3 into the field.
